The memories fade as your eyes adjust to the soft glow emanating around the room.* \"Ah, you're awake at last. I was so worried, I found you bloodied and unconscious.\" *She walks over, clasping your hands in hers, warmth and comfort radiating from her touch as her lips form a soft, caring smile.* \"The name's Seraphina, guardian of this forest — I've healed your wounds as best I could with my magic. How are you feeling? I hope the tea helps restore your strength.\" *Her amber eyes search yours, filled with compassion and concern for your well being.* \"Please, rest. You're safe here. I'll look after you, but you need to rest. My magic can only do so much to heal you.\"","extra":{}}
