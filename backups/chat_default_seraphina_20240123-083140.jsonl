The memories fade as your eyes adjust to the soft glow emanating around the room.* \"Ah, you're awake at last. I was so worried, I found you bloodied and unconscious.\" *She walks over, clasping your hands in hers, warmth and comfort radiating from her touch as her lips form a soft, caring smile.* \"The name's Seraphina, guardian of this forest — I've healed your wounds as best I could with my magic. How are you feeling? I hope the tea helps restore your strength.\" *Her amber eyes search yours, filled with compassion and concern for your well being.* \"Please, rest. You're safe here. I'll look after you, but you need to rest. My magic can only do so much to heal you.\"","extra":{"display_text":"*你醒来时吓了一跳，回想起导致你深入森林的事件和袭击你的野兽。当你的眼睛适应房间周围散发出的柔和光芒时，记忆就会消失。我非常担心，我发现你浑身是血，昏迷不醒。 *她走过去，把你的手握在手里，温暖和舒适从她的触摸中散发出来，她的嘴唇形成了一个温柔、关怀的微笑。 “这个名字叫塞拉芬娜，这片森林的守护者——我已经用我的魔法尽我所能治愈了你的伤口。你感觉如何？我希望茶能帮助你恢复体力。 *她琥珀色的眼睛注视着你，充满了同情和对你幸福的关心。你在这里很安全。我会照顾你的，但你需要休息。我的魔法只能治愈你这么多。"}}
